          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I an undergraduate, age 23, residing in Rivers State
            Nigeria. I am enrolled at Altschool Africa where I'm presented
            with the opportunity to become a software developer, and I am
            determined to give it my utmost dedication.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the time i've spent learing from my instructors and engaging with other students I've acquired a good understanding of HTML and CSS to a point where I'm able to build web application at a competent level. I aim to complete the program with the confidence that I have
            gained a solid foundation, enabling me to approach any problem
            with competence. My primary goal is to acquire comprehensive
            skills in frontend development during the duration of the program.
